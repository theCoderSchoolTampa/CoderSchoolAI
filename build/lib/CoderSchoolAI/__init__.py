"""
CoderSchoolAI: A Python Module designed for teaching Modern Day AI to Kids.

This package includes a range of educational tools and templates designed to simplify complex concepts and offer improved learning opportunities. 
It enables the exploration of foundational principles of problem-solving through Artificial Intelligence, providing structured guidance for the exploration and 
implementation of theoretical concepts.

Key Features:
 - Learning Curriculum: Our module makes learning programming engaging and fun, turning complex ideas into digestible chunks.
 - Educational Tools and Templates: We provide tools and templates to simplify complex concepts and enhance learning opportunities.
 - Exploration of Foundational Concepts: Our module enables the exploration of foundational principles of problem-solving through Artificial Intelligence.
 - Structural Guidance: We offer structured guidance for exploring and implementing theoretical concepts in a hands-on way.
 - Simplified Machine Learning Principles: Our module breaks down complex machine learning principles to facilitate understanding and utilization of these fundamental mechanisms.
 - Training Agents/Bots: Users can train agents or bots to play games, leveraging principles of data engineering and neural networks.
 
Algorithms Available:
 - Deep-Q w/ Target Network: Deep-Q is a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a target network
 
The goal of this module is to make Agent AI and machine learning more accessible and enjoyable to learn.

Future Enhancements:

 - Support for multiple agents/bots in a single game.
 - PPO, DDPG, SAC, TD3, PPO2, DDPG2, SAC2
