    "Python functions are like Lego Blocks that we can use again and again to build code! Just like a lego-set, you might have 5x of one type of piece, but that piece can do many different things.  You as the programmer can use a function whenever you need it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions in Python are defined using the keyword `def`, followed by the function name and parentheses `()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Functions in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of functions as little self-contained programs that can perform a specific task. You give some information to the function (these are called **arguments**), it does something with that info, and then it gives you back a result!\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(say_hello_in_spanish())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python functions can take arguments.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Arguments are pieces of information that are passed into a function. You can think of them as the ingredients for your magic spell!\n",

    "    if language == \"Spanish\":\n",

    "    return num1 + num2\n",
    "\n",
    "result = add_two_numbers(1, 2)\n",
    "print(result)  # Prints 3\n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine you're playing the game of Snake where you control a snake trying to eat apples. The game's world (the environment) changes with each move you make.\n",

    "\n",
    "**2. Step Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def step(self, action: Union[int, np.ndarray, Dict[str, ActionAttribute]], d_t:float) -> Tuple[Union[Dict[str, ObsAttribute], ObsAttribute, np.ndarray], Union[int, float], Union[bool, np.ndarray]]:\n",

    "        - done flag\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `step` function is like making a move in the game. You give it an action (like moving the snake), and it changes the state of the game (like moving the snake to a new position). Then it tells you what happened: the new state of the game, if you got any points (the reward), and if the game is over (the done flag).\n",

    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `get_current_reward` function is like a scoreboard. After you make a move, it checks if you got any points. In the Snake game, you get points when the snake eats an apple.\n",
