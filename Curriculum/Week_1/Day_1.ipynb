We might even teach our characters to learn from their mistakes, just like us! By the end of this course, you'll be a Python whizz, a game master, and an AI explorer. Let's get started!\n"

    "\n",
    "In Python, a variable is a piece of information that we care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is helpful to think of variables as a box that holds data which **can be changed** later throughout programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to create a variable named **x** and assign it the value 10, we can do so by writing:\n",
    "\n",
    "> x = 10. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, **=** is the assignment operator in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use different types of variables in Python, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. numbers\n",
    ">**h, e, l, l, o, = 1, 2, 3, 0.5, -20.2**\n",
    "2. words/strings of letters\n",
    ">**x, y, z = 'Hello, World!', 'Jack and Jill went down a Hill', 'https://YouTube.com/'**\n",
    "3. truth-values\n",
    "> **x= True #(True or False)**\n",
    "4. a List of Variables\n",
    "> **x = [True, 1, 'Jack is Still going down a Hill', 'https://YouTube.com/']**\n",
    "5. a Dictionary of Variables \n",
    "> **x = {\"Alphabet\": \"A list of letters spoken in a Language\", \"Language\": \"English\", \"Year\": 2020, \"IsDoneWithSchool\": False, 2020: \"Was once said to be Heinsight\" }**\n",
    "6. Tuples! Tup-and-a-what-now? A Tuple is like a list that cannot be changed!\n",
    "> **x = (True, 1, 'Jill has reached the Bottom of the Hill')**\n",
    "\n",
    " and more! We will cover this later, but for now, let's go ahead and see a few examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extra information about Variables!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variables in Python are case-sensitive which means name, Name and NAME are three different variables in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python, variable names are also referred to as identifiers. There are few rules that you have to follow while naming the variables in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The name of the variable must always start with either a letter or an underscore (_).\n",
    "- The name of the variable cannot start with a number.\n",
    "- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and _).\n",
    "- Reserved words (like Python keywords) cannot be used as variable names."
