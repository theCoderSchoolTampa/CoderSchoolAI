    "It is helpful to think of variables as a box that holds data which **can be changed** later throughout programming.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> x = 10. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, **=** is the assignment operator in Python.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. numbers\n",
    ">**h, e, l, l, o, = 1, 2, 3, 0.5, -20.2**\n",

    ">**x, y, z = 'Hello, World!', 'Jack and Jill went down a Hill', 'https://YouTube.com/'**\n",
    "3. truth-values\n",
    "> **x= True #(True or False)**\n",

    "- Variables in Python are case-sensitive which means name, Name and NAME are three different variables in Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "- In Python, variable names are also referred to as identifiers. There are few rules that you have to follow while naming the variables in Python:\n",

    "- The name of the variable cannot start with a number.\n",
