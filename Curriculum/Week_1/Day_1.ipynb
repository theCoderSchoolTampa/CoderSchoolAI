    "**Python**\n",
    "- Python is like a language that computers understand. It's one of the easiest computer languages to learn, and it's what we're going to use to build our own computer games!\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Game Logic**\n",
    "- Game Logic is like the rule book for a game. It tells us how the game is played, what we can and can't do, and how to win. When we're making our own games, we get to write the rule book!\n",

    "\n",
    "**Game Theory**\n",
    "- Game Theory is a super cool way of thinking about games. It helps us understand what the best move is, depending on what we think the other players will do. It's a bit like trying to think several moves ahead in a game of chess.\n",

    "- Agent Artificial Intelligence, or AI for short, is about making our computer games smart. An AI agent in a game could be a dragon, a treasure-hunting pirate, or even a clever mouse that has to navigate a maze. We'll learn how to make these characters do smart things, all by themselves!\n",

    ">In this course, we're going on an adventure! We'll start by learning Python and using it to build our own games. We'll be the game masters, deciding the rules and how to win. Then, we'll dive into the world of game theory and AI, learning how to make our games more exciting and our characters smarter. We might even teach our characters to learn from their mistakes, just like us! By the end of this course, you'll be a Python whizz, a game master, and an AI explorer. Let's get started!\n"

    "\n",
    "In Python, a variable is a piece of information that we care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is helpful to think of variables as a box that holds data which **can be changed** later throughout programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to create a variable named **x** and assign it the value 10, we can do so by writing:\n",
    "\n",
    "> x = 10. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, **=** is the assignment operator in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use different types of variables in Python, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. numbers\n",
    ">**h, e, l, l, o, = 1, 2, 3, 0.5, -20.2**\n",
    "2. words/strings of letters\n",
    ">**x, y, z = 'Hello, World!', 'Jack and Jill went down a Hill', 'https://YouTube.com/'**\n",
    "3. truth-values\n",
    "> **x= True #(True or False)**\n",
    "4. a List of Variables\n",
    "> **x = [True, 1, 'Jack is Still going down a Hill', 'https://YouTube.com/']**\n",
    "5. a Dictionary of Variables \n",
    "> **x = {\"Alphabet\": \"A list of letters spoken in a Language\", \"Language\": \"English\", \"Year\": 2020, \"IsDoneWithSchool\": False, 2020: \"Was once said to be Heinsight\" }**\n",
    "\n",
    " and more! We will cover this later, but for now, let's go ahead and write a few examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extra information about Variables!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variables in Python are case-sensitive which means name, Name and NAME are three different variables in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python, variable names are also referred to as identifiers. There are few rules that you have to follow while naming the variables in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The name of the variable must always start with either a letter or an underscore (_).\n",
    "- The name of the variable cannot start with a number.\n",
    "- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and _).\n",
    "- Reserved words (like Python keywords) cannot be used as variable names."
