    "## 1. Variables and Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are a way of storing information in Python. We have several basic data types in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integer**: Whole numbers, like `5`, `10`, or `-3`.\n",
    "- **Float**: Decimal numbers, like `2.5`, `3.14`, or `-0.01`.\n",
    "- **String**: Sequences of characters, like `\"Hello, world!\"`, `\"snake\"`, or `\"apple\"`.\n",
    "- **Boolean**: Either `True` or `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define some variables for the Snake game\n",
    "snake_length = 5  # an integer\n",
    "apple_position = (2.0, 3.0)  # a tuple of floats\n",
    "game_over = False  # a boolean\n",
    "direction = \"up\"  # a string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of our Snake game, we might use an integer to represent the length of the snake, a tuple of floats to represent the position of the apple, a boolean to indicate whether the game is over, and a string to represent the current direction of the snake.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is like a box in the computerâ€™s memory where you can store a single value. If you want to use the result of an evaluated expression later in your program, you can save it inside a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how you create a variable in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Syntax: variable_name = value\n",
    "snake_length = 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Snake game, for example, you might want to store the length of the snake, the position of the apple, the current score, etc. in variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "snake_length = 3  # storing the length of the snake\n",
    "apple_position = (5, 5)  # storing the position of the apple\n",
    "score = 0  # storing the current score\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also store complex data structures like lists or dictionaries in variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# List of positions of each segment of the snake\n",
    "snake_body = [(3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dictionary storing the number of apples eaten and the current score\n",
    "stats = {\"apples_eaten\": 0, \"score\": 0}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Demonstration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "snake_length = 3  # storing the length of the snake\n",
    "apple_position = (5, 5)  # storing the position of the apple\n",
    "score = 0  # storing the current score\n",
    "snake_body = [(3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)] # storing the snake body\n",
    "stats = {\"apples_eaten\": 0, \"score\": 0} # storing stats\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Snake Length: \", snake_length)\n",
    "print(\"Apple Position: \", apple_position)\n",
    "print(\"Score: \", score)\n",
    "print(\"Snake Body: \", snake_body)\n",
    "print(\"Stats: \", stats)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can reference these variables throughout the code, update their values, and use their current values to perform operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, variable names in Python can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores and can't start with a number. Also, Python is case-sensitive, so `score` and `Score` would be different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we'll explore more Python basics including mathematical operations, control flow (if/else statements and loops), and functions, while relating them to the context of our Snake game."

    "# Functions and Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "In this markdown, we will explore the concept of functions and conditional statements in Python. These are important tools in any programmer's toolkit, and they are critical to understand when dealing with reinforcement learning and agent AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions in Python are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. You can think of functions as mini-programs within your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements, on the other hand, allow your program to make decisions based on certain conditions. These conditions could be the result of a comparison (like `if x > y`) or the result of a function call (like `if is_game_over()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is defined with the `def` keyword in Python. It can take arguments, and it can return a value. Here's a simple function that adds two numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add_two_numbers(x, y):\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can call this function with two numbers, and it will return their sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = add_two_numbers(3, 5)\n",
    "print(result)  # Outputs: 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions in SnakeEnvironment\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have seen, there are four key functions that manage the state and actions of the Snake game:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `reset`: This function resets the game to its initial state.\n",
    "2. `step`: This function takes an action and returns the new state, reward, and done flag.\n",
    "3. `get_current_reward`: This function returns the current reward for a specified action and state.\n",
    "4. `get_next_action`: This function decides the next action to take based on the current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see how these functions work together to manage the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "A conditional statement in Python allows you to make decisions based on certain conditions. The most common type of conditional statement is an `if` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if x > y:\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than y\")\n",
    "elif x < y:\n",
    "    print(\"x is less than y\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is equal to y\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This block of code will print different messages depending on the relative values of `x` and `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Statements in SnakeEnvironment\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the Snake game, conditional statements could be used to check if the snake has eaten an apple, or if it has hit a wall or its own body. Here's an example of how you might use a conditional statement to check if the game is over:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if snake_env.is_game_over():\n",
    "    print(\"Game over!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Game continues...\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, `snake_env.is_game_over()` is a function that returns `True` if the game is over and `False` otherwise. The `if` statement checks the result of this function to decide what message to print.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's practice writing functions and using conditional statements in the context of the Snake game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's some skeleton code for the `step` function. Try filling it in based on what you've learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def step(self, action):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Updates the Environment Status Stuff!\n",
    "    Example: \n",
    "    - snake_env = SnakeEnv(...)\n",
    "    - perform_update(snake_env)\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    reward, finished = env.get_current_reward(0) # Gets the Score/Reward from moving the Snake!\n",
    "    if not finished:\n",
    "       env.update_observation_variables()\n",
    "       for name, obs in env.ObsAttributes.items():\n",
    "           obs.update_func()\n",
    "    else: # Resets the Environment\n",
    "        if env.consumed_apple():\n",
    "            env.snake_agent.increment_score()\n",
    "        env.reset()\n",
