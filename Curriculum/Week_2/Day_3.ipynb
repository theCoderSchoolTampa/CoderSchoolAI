    "# Basics of Neural Networks for the Snake Game\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial aims to cover the essentials of building a neural network to play the snake game. The main points are: understanding neural networks, understanding the data, and using the CoderSchoolAI.Neural library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Networks are a set of algorithms modeled after the human brain. They are designed to recognize patterns, which makes them useful in machine learning and artificial intelligence applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of our Snake game, we'll be building a neural network to make decisions based on the game's current state. Given the current state, our network will be responsible for deciding which move (up, down, left, right) will maximize the chances of winning the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Snake game, our data comes in the form of the game state, actions, and reward:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State**: The state of the game is like a snapshot of what the game looks like right now. In Snake, the state might be the position of the snake and the position of the apple.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Actions**: Actions are the things you can do in the game. In Snake, the actions would be moving up, down, left, or right.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reward**: The reward is what the game gets for performing an action. In Snake, the reward might be the points received for eating an apple or a penalty for crashing into a wall or the snake itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CoderSchoolAI.Neural Library\n",
    "\n",
    "This library provides tools to easily build and manipulate deep neural networks. We will be using the Net class to build our neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a brief overview of the classes and methods provided by the library:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Net Class\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the main class that will be used to build the network structure. It has the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__(self, network_name:str= \"basic_net\", is_dict_network=False, device: th.device = th.device('cpu'))`: This initializes the Net. It can be named for organization, declared as a dictionary network, and assigned a specific device for computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `add_block(self, block: Block)`: Adds a Block connection to the network. The type of Block is based on the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `compile(self)`: Once all blocks have been added, this function will compile the network and prepare it for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `forward(self, x: th.Tensor)`: This function is called during training to pass the input data through the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `copy(self)`: This function copies the current network, useful for creating multiple instances of the same network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### InputBlock Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The InputBlock is the first layer of the network, it takes in the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__(self, in_attribute:Union[Attribute, Dict[str, Attribute]], is_module_dict:bool=False, device: th.device = th.device('cpu'))`: Initializes the InputBlock with attributes, declares if it is a module dictionary, and assigns the computational device.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `forward(self, x) -> th.Tensor`: This function is called during training to pass the input data through the block.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LinearBlock Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The LinearBlock is a fully connected layer of the network (MLP).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__(self, input_size: int, output_size: int, num_hidden_layers: int = 3, hidden_size: Union[int, List[int]] = 128, activation: Optional[Callable] = None, device: th.device = th.device('cpu'))`: Initializes the LinearBlock with the input size, output size, number of hidden layers, size of hidden layers, an optional activation function, and the device for computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `forward(self, x: th.Tensor) -> th.Tensor`: This function is called during training to pass the input data through the block.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ConvBlock Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The ConvBlock class is for building convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an explanation of the main methods within this class:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__(self, input_shape: int, num_channels: int, depth: int = 3, disable_max_pool: bool = False, desired_output_size: int = None, activation: Optional[Callable] = None, device: th.device = th.device('cpu'))`: Initializes the ConvBlock with various parameters including input shape, number of channels, depth (i.e. the number of convolutional layers), and optional parameters such as max pooling disablement, desired output size, and activation function. The computational device can also be set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `forward(self, x) -> th.Tensor`: This function is called during training to pass the input data through the block. It first checks the input shape to ensure it matches the expected input shape for the ConvBlock, and raises an error if the shape doesn't match. It then passes the input through the block's module (which is a sequence of convolutional, activation and pooling layers) to generate the output. If the block has forward connections, it calls the forward method on the next block in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OutputBlock Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The OutputBlock is the final layer of the network which outputs the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__(self, input_size, num_classes, device: th.device = th.device('cpu'))`: Initializes the OutputBlock some specified input size to output some number of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `forward(self, x: th.Tensor) -> th.Tensor`: This function is called during training to pass the input data through the block.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Putting it all Together\n",
    "\n",
    "To put all of this together for our Snake game, we will need to create a neural network that can take the game's current state and output a decision for the next action. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create InputBlock**: We'll need an InputBlock to take in our game state. The state can be an array containing information about the snake's position, the apple's position, and any other relevant game information.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    snake_env = SnakeEnv(width=16, height=16)\n",
    "    input_block = InputBlock(in_attribute=snake_env.snake_agent.get_q_table_state(), is_module_dict=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create Hidden Layers (LinearBlocks)**: These layers will do the computation based on our input. The exact number and size of these layers can vary depending on the complexity of the game and the sophistication of the strategy you want to develop.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    snake_env = SnakeEnv(width=16, height=16)\n",
    "    input_block = InputBlock(in_attribute=snake_env.snake_agent.get_q_table_state(), is_module_dict=False)\n",
    "    lin_block = LinearBlock(input_size=len(snake_env.snake_agent.get_q_table_state()), num_hidden_layers=3, hidden_size=128, dropout=0.05)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create Image Filter Blocks (ConvBlocks)**: This is a basic architecture commonly used for any image processing tasks. Our SnakeEnv has a GameState which just so happends to be an Image!\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    snake_env = SnakeEnv(width=16, height=16)\n",
    "    input_block = InputBlock(in_attribute=snake_env.get_attribute(\"game_state\"), is_module_dict=False)\n",
    "    conv_block = ConvBlock(input_shape=input_block.in_attribute.space.shape,num_channels=1,depth=3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create OutputBlock**: Finally, we need an OutputBlock that will output the decision for the next move. This will usually be a single value indicating the direction to move (up, down, left, right).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # Output Example with ConvBlocks!\n",
    "    snake_env = SnakeEnv(width=16, height=16)\n",
    "    input_block = InputBlock(in_attribute=snake_env.get_attribute(\"game_state\"), is_module_dict=False)\n",
    "    conv_block = ConvBlock(input_shape=input_block.in_attribute.space.shape,num_channels=1,depth=3)\n",
    "    OutputBlock(input_size=conv_block.output_size, num_classes=len(snake_env.snake_agent.get_actions()))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # Output Example with LinearBlocks!\n",
    "    snake_env = SnakeEnv(width=16, height=16)\n",
    "    input_block = InputBlock(in_attribute=snake_env.snake_agent.get_q_table_state(), is_module_dict=False)\n",
    "    lin_block = LinearBlock(input_size=len(snake_env.snake_agent.get_q_table_state()), num_hidden_layers=3, hidden_size=128, dropout=0.05)\n",
    "    OutputBlock(input_size=lin_block.output_size, num_classes=len(snake_env.snake_agent.get_actions()))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compile the Network**: Once all blocks have been added, compile the network with `compile()` method of the Net class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # Build the Network from Blocks\n",
    "    net = Net()\n",
    "    net.add_block(input_block)\n",
    "    net.add_block(conv_block)\n",
    "    net.add_block(out_block)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Compile the Network!\n",
    "    net.compile()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Train the Network**: After compiling the network, we'll need to train it. This involves playing the game many times and adjusting the weights of the network based on the outcomes. This process is usually facilitated by reinforcement learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    `Think about training a computer to play a video game. It's a lot like teaching a dog a new trick: we want the computer to learn how to do something really well.`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Game**: `In the game, our computer (which we'll call the 'agent') is going to play   many rounds (or 'episodes') of the game. In each round, it will try different things to see what works.`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deep Q-Learning**:` We're using a special training method called 'Deep Q-Learning.'     This is a set of rules that tells the agent how to play and learn from the game. It's kind  of like the rule book for the agent.`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Epsilon-Greedy Strategy**: `To start, the agent mostly guesses what to do (we call  these 'actions'). But, over time, it starts to learn which actions work best. It still   guesses sometimes, though, because that could lead to even better actions. We call this the 'Epsilon-Greedy Strategy.' `\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory**: `Just like how you remember your best games, the agent also stores its    experiences (the game state, its actions, and rewards) in its memory. This helps it learn  over time.`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Learning**:` After each episode, the agent takes a look at its memory and learns from   it. It then adjusts its playing strategy based on what it learned.`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Playing the Game**: `The agent keeps playing the game, adjusting its strategy, and  filling its memory. It does this for a lot of episodes, and with each episode, it should   get a little better!`\n"
